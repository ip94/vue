            <p class="card-text">
                For someone who had no prior experience with Javascript, learning Vue was still quite a sharp learning curve. However, as I slowly make sense of the various concepts mentioned in the tutorial, especially how communication among components is achieved, everything fall into place and it is easy to implement.

            <h2 class="card-title">Did it perform to my expectation?</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                Yes. From the experience, I can fully agree that the flexible built of Vue.js allows any developer to create a page to their own customization. In combination of using promise, a page can render quickly even with complex functions interpreting data in the back.

            <h2 class="card-title">In terms of installation and configuration</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                The installation process with command line input is very intuitive. Resources on how to do so can be easily found online. However, it took me a while to figure out the usage of NPM and CLI package. I encountered problems at first in terms of moving an existent project into web server or importing vue files into project, but after restarting a new project and figuring out which files to move onto the web server it performs well.

            <h2 class="card-title">Was it easy to create a page?</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                The most difficult part of creating the page was to utilize the component structures in Vue. Creating any page in Vue is quite straightforward since the HTML display is easily set up in the template section of the files. A complex page, however, may take much longer in planning.

            <h2 class="card-title">Would I have done things differently in retrospect?</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                In retrospect, I think I would spend some more time to use Vue router to create multiple pages and url links and route them together. For this particular project, I used the webpack simple to initiate. I could have also used webpack with full feature to experience Vue in a more comprehensive manner.

            <h2 class="card-title">Did I regret my choice of framework?</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                I donâ€™t regret my choice of learning Vue.js as part of this project. I think that learning Javascript syntax for a framework in such a short time is made easier with Vue. However, having learnt Vue, I would still want to head in the direction of learning ReactJS because it is more popular and more in demand. Overall, this framework gave me a pleasant experience in front-end dynamic website as it is very different from the many back-end languages we have learned so far in the course.
